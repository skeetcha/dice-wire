A framework for the Godot engine to create TTRPG games for Advanced 5th Edition, Pathfinder 2nd Edition, and more.

OGL 5th Edition will be added once more content is released into its System Reference Document (SRD) in Feburary 2025, and thus able to be used under the Creative Commons license.

All content included in this repository is accessed through the Open RPG Creative (ORC) License. Any mechanical content created using this framework is required to be licensed back to the community through the ORC License.

## Pathfinder 2E Updates

Currently at time of writing, this repository will only include character creation options present in the Player Core. Player Core 2 content will be added once that is finished.

## Starfinder 2E Updates

Currently at time of writing, Starfinder 2E is still in its playtest phase. Once the game is fully released, I will look at integrating it into this framework.
